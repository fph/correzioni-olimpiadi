INDENTATION
	Only tabs
	
SPACING:
	Instead of giving rules for spacing, we show two examples with _correct_ spacing:
	
	function f(par1, par2, par3) {
		var dummy = 100 * 20;
		if (true && !(dummy == 1000)) {
			return 1 + 2;
		}
		else {
			return 5;
		}
	}

NAMING
	Single-word variable: lowercase
	Multiple-words variable: CamelCase
	Variable passed to the View by the Model: v_VariableNameFollowingPrecedingRules

	This rules have to be applied also to id and className in html and to all variables both in javascript and in php.
	For data attributes snake_case should be used instead, as Uppercase isn't supported.

	FileNames: Always CamelCase, also single-word names, apart from 'index.php' which must be written this way.
	Database Tables: Always CamelCase, also single-word names.

QUOTES:
	Strings should always be delimited by single quotes. Possible exceptions include: strings containing \n (in php), strings containing single quotes.
