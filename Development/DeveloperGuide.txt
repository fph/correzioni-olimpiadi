# Development

Constants.php : 
	Configuration variables of the system.
Utilities.php : 
	Functions used to include files of the project (to use instead of the classic include or require)
sqlUtilities.php : 
	A group of function used to create query, to make query, to open db connection and to manipulate the result. This function are the only way in which php-files should interact with the db.
PermissionManager.php :
	A php file to handle permissions.
SessionManager.php : 
	A php file to handle session.
TemplateCreation.php : 
	The file which creates all the html pages shown in the browser. It is based on the function TemplatePage which receive the $content=View name, and various other optional parameters. This is the MUST in order to create the page for a Model file.
	It automatically builds the template of the page, includes some css and js and then put the content in the right position.

Model folder:
	In this folder there are the php which are called directly by the user. (and so those which appears in the url bar) 
	These files have to parse user input, to check user's permissions and to make db query, to call TemplatePage.
	In order to pass information to the View files you have to use a variable named $v_VARIABLENAME and to declare it global.

View folder:
	It contains the php pages which render the html to send to the user. Those must be nearly pure html, with the minimum needed php.
	js,css, images folder obviously contain what their names say.
	
Modify Folder:
	It contains the files which answers to request of the user to change the database.

# Important Javascript Files

TableManager.js: 	
	It is the manager of all the tables with class InformationTables which appears in the site.
	In order to add one of those tables to the html just use the function InsertTable (in TemplateCreation.php).
	The structure of table object is described in the file Documentation/TableObject.txt.

Other js works in a similar way of TableManager: DateInput.js and AjaxSelect.js LinkTable.js

DateInput.js:
	Renders forms for getting dates. Works as TableManager but the date object is an object containing as only property id, which is the identifier id of the dateinput.

AjaxSelect.js:
	Renders combobox implementing ajax. Works as TableManager but the select object is an object containing two property: id, type.
	id is just the identifier of the dom, instead type is the type of content to suggest to the user.
	The type can assume these values: 'contest', 'contestant', 'user'.
	The corresponding server-side of AjaxSelect is the file Modify/SelectSuggestions.php. It receives the string written by the user (and the type of the select) and returns all possible options.

LinkTable.js:
	Renders a list of links. Works as TableManager but the LinkTable object is an array of objects with this properties:
		name => string,
		redirect => [ url => string, parameters => object ]
		
ButtonsManager.js:
	Renders buttons (small clickable icons). Works as TableManager but the buttons object has the following structure:
		title => boolean,
		table => boolean,
		buttons => [ ButtonType=>[ hidden=>boolean, onclick=>string] ]
		
# Running a development environment

    cd Development
    docker compose up

This creates a few docker containers that run a development instance of the project.

The development instance is then available on http://localhost:8024.

Click on the `InitDatabase.php` button in the home page to populate a sample database for development. This includes a few sample users; you can find their credential by opening `InitDatabase.php`.

To recreate the database, use `docker compose down`, since the development database is saved inside the `correzioni-devel-db` image.

Instead of being sent normally, mail messages sent using this development instance can be read on http://localhost:8025.

In case you change `Development/Dockerfile`, remember to rebuild the image with `docker compose build`.

To open a shell on the development container, use

	docker exec -it correzioni-devel-db bash

To open a Mysql/Mariadb session, use

	docker exec -it correzioni-devel-db mariadb -u root -pSecret CorOli
